# S3-Bouncy-Glow-Music
This mod tries it's best at giving you the refinements of S3 prototype tracks from the Bouncy Glow's Music Room!  (With using highest possible quality rips!)

The chosen refinements are:
Proto Carnival Night Act 1

Proto Carnival Night Act 2

Proto Ice Cap Act 1 (3D Blast-Styled)

Proto Ice Cap Act 2 (S3AIR Remaster)

Proto Launch Base Act 1 (PC Pitch)

Proto Launch Base Act 2

Blue Spheres (Remastered) (it speeds up!)

[V3] Unused Super Sonic

missing tracks replaced by the S3AIR remasters that sound even better than the normal rips in a simmilar way that CW and Stealth did it! so say goodbye to the low pass filter and other annoyances!

Anyways, i hope you'll like my first ever mod! Please report any issues in the issues tab.
